# powershell-mouse-operations

A collection of utiltiies that helps AI/ML image processing developers/SQAs to stimulate operations such as mouse move, drag and other activities

#Background
I was working on AI/ML image processing algorithm test and found some descrepencies. When we talked to respective algorithm developer, it was not an easy task to reproduce issue in development environment. The fuctional tools needed a specific setup as well as some flexibility in terms to debug the issue to the greater extent. It is that moement we feel I wanted some utility that would give more freedome to algorithm developer. There are many tools available in the market however every tool will have have its pros and cons depends upon installation/usage/COTS-SOUPS/Process/licenses. Hence aiming for this inhouse utlity that gives break from all these constraints

## Highlights
> This repository will have basic utilities that will perform mouse activities
